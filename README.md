# OnlineApplicationReviewAnalysis

Sentiment analysis is the classification of a customer’s reviews or comments as positive, negative, and sometimes neutral also. 
Most businesses analyze their customers’ feelings about their products or services to find out what their customers want from them. 
Google play store has millions of apps with their reviews, so it will be a good use case of sentiment analysis to analyze the sentiment of 
apps available on the google play store.

Google Play Store can be found on all Android smartphones and tablets. This is the official Google app store for the Android operating system.

and comments is what we do in the Sentiment Analysis task. Having said that, in the section below, I will walk you through the Google Play Store
